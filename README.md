# 1. Iris_flower_project README
## “This project uses a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier (k=3) to predict Iris species from sepal and petal measurements. The notebook performs EDA (pairplots and summary statistics), splits the data into training and testing sets (70/30), trains a KNN model, and evaluates it using accuracy and classification metrics. Because KNN relies on distances, the notebook includes notes on feature scaling and shows how to improve the model via cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.”

# 2. Car_price_pridiction_projrct README 
## This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the selling price of cars based on various features such as year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more.
## It demonstrates the end-to-end ML workflow: from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model building, evaluation, and deployment readiness.

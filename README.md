# “This project uses a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier (k=3) to predict Iris species from sepal and petal measurements. The notebook performs EDA (pairplots and summary statistics), splits the data into training and testing sets (70/30), trains a KNN model, and evaluates it using accuracy and classification metrics. Because KNN relies on distances, the notebook includes notes on feature scaling and shows how to improve the model via cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.”
